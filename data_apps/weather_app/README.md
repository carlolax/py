# weather_app.py
This Python app was made to collect OpenWeatherMap data using the free API key from my IP's location and save it to a json file which I will used for forecasting and served as a practice. You can get the API key for free by registering.

### App requirements:
Python >= 3.11.7, pyttsx3, requests, datetime, geocoder, and json packages.

### Project's idea:
The app's idea is to collect OpenWeatherData through API, interpret it using text-to-speech before saving it on a json file. Any features that are feasible will be added in the future as a practice for efficiency and effectiveness with Python programming language.
