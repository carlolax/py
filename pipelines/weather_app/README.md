# weather_app.py
The Python app was made to collect weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API key from my location and save it to a json file for weather forecasting. The data collected is preprocessed and stored to a data silo (JSON file) and data warehouse (Postgres). You can get the API key for free by registering.

### App requirements:
Python >= 3.11.7, configparser, datetime, functools, json, logging, typing, psycopg2-binary, pyowm, geocoder, contextlib, cachetools, tenacity, traceback, geopy, time, threading, queue, regex, Dask, atexit, and OpenWeatherMap API.
