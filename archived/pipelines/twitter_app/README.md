# weather_app.py
The Python app was made to collect tweets data using friend's Twitter Developer account (switching to my account once I have created an account to use.)

### App requirements:
Python >= 3.11.7, tweepy, textblob, json, and csv.

#### ON HOLD:
Unable to register to Twitter Developer page due to SMS concerns. Will try again tomorrow. Currently using my friend's account.
