# clean_desktop_app.py
The Python app was made to automatically delete files and folders on your desktop after scheduling it your operating system's scheduler. This generates a text file "deletion_log.txt" to provide the names of the files deleted when running the code.

### App requirements:
Python >= 3.11.7, os, platform, and datetime.

### HEADS UP!
I am not responsible for any unnecessary file system failures in case that there are any tweaks and changes made on the code.
